   NEIGHBOURHOOD

   Moved out of GraphCanvas.tsx's `highlight(idx)`. Breadth-first walk from a
   hovered/selected node over the incidence list, writing per-node depth and
   per-edge tier. Three tiers result: incident edges at 1, edges inside the
   neighbourhood at TIER_NEARBY, everything else at 0.

   `outTier` is dense (Float32Array(m)) rather than the strided `eP2` lane the
   caller ultimately writes into — GraphCanvas scatters it into
   `eP2[e * 4 + A_TIER]` after the call. That costs one O(m) copy per hover
   change, not per frame, and buys an interface that doesn't take a stride and
   an offset.
